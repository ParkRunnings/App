#  CHANGELOG

## v1.3.0
→ Updated for WatchOS 10 compatibility
→ Resolved several CoreData concurrency issues
→ Resolved a rare date based issue causing crashes for users in Australia/NZ

## v1.2.0
This version contains several minor bug fixes. Thanks to u/TheTechBox & u/Foulenough1 for reporting them!

→ A fix for a network issue that would result in intermittent crashes when the app was offline
→ Fixes for a visual glitch with chart legends on 41mm & 40mm watch sizes

## v1.1.0
→ A new statistics area has been added allowing you to track key metrics about your ParkRuns like PBs, club progression & attendance streaks. For WatchOS 9 users, charts have also been added, giving you an in-depth breakdown of your recent performances.
→ A second new section has been added giving you a full historical view of all your ParkRun results. Whether you're Darren Wood with 815 runs under your belt, or have only completed your second run, you'll now be able to re-live them all in app.
